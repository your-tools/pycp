== General ==

* Better handling of exceptional conditions:

Right now, it's probably possible to loose files when using pymv ...
but it's hard to test

* Fix failing test on windows

* Display several lines of progress bars?

Example:

Copying from old/ to new/                         ( 431 M total)
 33% - [#############                          ] - (1 files / 3)
 50% - [#######       ] - File #2  -  24.97 B/s | ETA:  00:00:02


* Fix high CPU usage, maybe with adaptive / higher buffer size

* Add --ask-once option


== Packaging ==

Find a way to automate the packaging process, from the git tag to the publication
to Pypi, ubuntu PPA and AUR, and the pycp web page.

(Pycp web page: switch from .txt to html, and use the README.rst to generate the
page)

Introduce setup.py.in, and PKGBUILD.in, configured with the version number.

Stop using help2man, and use docutils for the man page.
(with the "USAGE" section of the man page generated by OptParse, of course)
