PYCP: cp with a progressbar

DESCRIPTION
-----------

pycp / pymv are meant to be used from the command line.


Main idea : forking a file transfer in background,
while reading the size of the destination.

Make use of the wonderful libraries progressbar by Nilton Volpato.

Comes with two scripts: pycp and pymv, calling FileTransferManager with
proper action (copy or move)

INSTALLATION
------------

  easy_install pycp

is probably the easiest way.


There are also other ways to install pycp:


* Windows

Pycp installers are available on Pypi:
http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pycp/

Make sure you put "c:\Python26\Scripts" in your $PATH.


* Linux:

Ubuntu: there are also pycp packages on this PPA:
http://launchpad.net/~yannick-lm/+archive/ppa

ArchLinux : a PKGBUILD is available on AUR:
http://aur.archlinux.org/packages.php?ID=29319



BUGS
---

Pycp would take much longer than cp if you're trying to monitor copy
of many little files

SEE ALSO
--------

* There is no way (yet) to have a "global progressbar" when transfering multiple
files.

If this feature is needed, vcp maybe the right choice for you (UNIX only)

* If you are looking for a more general solution to display progressbars when
performing command-line operations, see clpbar:
